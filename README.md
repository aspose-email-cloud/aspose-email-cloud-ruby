SDK reference documentation is available in [this README](docs/README.md)

### Prerequisites

To use this SDK, you need an App SID and an App Key; they can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (it requires free registration in Aspose Cloud for this).

### Installation
You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/aspose_email_cloud).

See more details about SDK installation in this tutorial: [SDK setup](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/emailcloud/SDK+setup)

### Usage examples
To use the API, you should create an EmailApi object:
```ruby
api = EmailApi.new('Your App Key', 'Your App Sid')
```

#### Business cards recognition API
Use `AiBcrParseModel` method to parse business card image to VCard DTO:
```ruby
image = File.open('/tmp/alex.png', 'rb') do |f|
bin = f.read
Base64.encode64(bin)
end
result = api.ai_bcr_parse_model(AiBcrParseModelRequestData.new(
AiBcrBase64Rq.new(nil, [AiBcrBase64Image.new(true, image)])))
contact = result.value[0]
```

See more details [here](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/emailcloud/Parse+Image+To+VCard+File) and [here](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/emailcloud/Business+Cards+Recognition+API)
